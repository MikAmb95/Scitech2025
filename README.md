**Scitech 2025: Shrinking Horizon Model Predictive Control for Spacecraft Robotic System: A Parameterized Approach**

The material in this folder can be used to perform the simulations proposed in the paper

Folder1: ParamSHMPC3dofArm_only_base_with_obstacles. The code in this folder allows obtaining numerical simulations related to the maneuver “Fly to hold position”.
Folder2: ParamSHMPC3dofArm_only_robot. The code in this folder allows obtaining numerical simulations related to the maneuver “Robot unfolding”.



Note: CASADI is required to perform the optimization control problem.  See: https://web.casadi.org/
